When the dice is still in your hand, the number of dots is a *random variable* - we don't know its value, and we can only say that it can take integer values from 1 to 6 with equal probability. The probability assigned to each outcome of a discrete random variable is called its *distribution*. Let's denote this random variable as $X$.    \n","\n","When you throw the dice, the number of dots is no longer random. By throwing the dice, you've obtained a *realiztion* of the random variable, which is a number $X(\\omega)$. In general, when we perform a \"random experiment\", such as throwing a set of $n$ dice, we fix $\\omega$ and our random variables $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ become numbers $X_1(\\omega), \\dots, X_n(\\omega)$. Note that we use a single $\\omega$ that realizes multiple random variables, rather than multiple $\\omega$'s that realize a single random variable - that way it's easier to analyze. The $\\omega$ is the experiment, and $X_i$ are the measured values. You don't need to care too much about $\\omega$ it in this course - this is the last time we'll see it. What matters is that, in statistics, all the data is interpreted as a realization of a sequence of random variables.   \n","\n","In practice, nobody writes $X_1(\\omega)$ or talks about *realizations* - we simply write $X_1$ and talk about random variables, because it's quite obvious from context whether we talk about variables or about numbers.  \n","\n","Probability theory, which you've learned in the previous semester, deals with analyzing the properties of random variables before they're realized. For this, we need to assume a fixed distribution of the random variable - for example, an uniform distribution over natural numbers from 1 to 6, or, in other applications, a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Then, we can ask \"what values are likely to be observed?\", or \"what is the average value of infinitely many observations\"?   \n","\n","In statistics, we're interested in an exactly reverse question: given a finite set of observations, i.e. a realization of a sequence of random variables, what can we say about their distribution? We usually assume that all the random variables are independent and identically distributed (\"i.i.d.\" for short). Furthermore, we usually don't assume that they can come from any probability distribution - instead, we assume that they come from some *parametric family* of distributions, i.e. ones that can be described with a set of parameters. The distribution of the number of dots on a dice is an example of such distribution - it can be described with five parameters (why not six?).\n","\n","In the next sections, we'll see how it works in practice.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yee6xRCFlfaP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pnpa_rkDoWlo"},"source":["## Data & library

Use the `human_protein_lengths.describe()` method to check the basic statistics of the numerical columns of the data frame.   \n","  3.1. What is the average length of a human protein?  \n","  3.2. What is the maximum length?  \n","4. Draw histograms that show the distributions of the protein lengths and log-lengths. I recommend using the `px.histogram()` function for this.  \n","  4.1. Which distribution is more spread around its average?   \n","  4.2. Does any distribution resemble the Normal (Gaussian) distribution?   \n","  4.3.

Calculate the average length and log-length and their standard deviations; Store them in variables `true_mean`, `true_mean_log`, `true_std` and `true_std_log`. We'll use them in subsequent exercises as our *ground truth* against which we'll evaluate our estimators.     \n","\n","*Quick question*. Is $\\text{true_mean}$ equal to $10^\\text{true_mean_log}$? Why/why not? (note that we've used the base-10 logarithm)\n","\n","*Why the base-10 logarithm?* In statistical data analysis, the base-10 logarithms are sometimes a convenient choice, because their values can be interpreted as orders of magnitude (or simply the numbers of digits) of our values. Although logarithms with different bases are mostly equivalent mathematically, an easier interpretation is important to get more meaningful conclusions from the data.\n","\n","*Why the standard deviation?* Some students may wonder why we prefer the standard deviation rather than the variance - after all, the difference is just a square root, so mathematically it's almost the same thing. Here, again, the reason is the interpretability of the results. When we compute the variance, we square the observations. As a consequence, their units also get squared. This means that, if we estimate the number of mushrooms in a forest, the variance is expressed in terms of *mushrooms squared*, which doesn't make any sense. Taking a square root brings the unit back to mushrooms.

This is the main reason why we derive properties of estimators, such as their expected value and variance. Good statisticians can derive estimators which need less observations and give better results.   \n","\n","First, let's talk about what it means to estimate from a statistician's point of view.  \n","\n","*Theory time.* When we throw a single dice many times, we get a sequence of i.i.d. observations $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ (I've ommitted $\\omega$ here, because I hope you already understand that $X_i$'s become numbers when we actually throw the dice). We can now calculate the proportion of throws which resulted in six dots - this is a simple estimation of the quantity $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=6)$. Mathematically, we would write it as follows. Let $[X_i = 6]$ denote a function that is equal $1$ if $X_i=6$ and $0$ otherwise (it's a random variable - we don't know its value before we throw the dice, but we know it once the dice is thrown). Now, we can define an *estimator*: $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n [X_i = 6]$. This is simply the proportion of throws that resulted in six dots. Finally, we can write that $\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(X_i = 6) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n [X_i = 6]$; a hat over $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=6)$ means that this is an estimator of the probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=6)$.  \n","\n","Just to make it even more clear: when we throw the dice, we get a sequence of numbers $X_i(\\omega)$ for $i=1,2, \\dots, n$, and when we actually calculate the proportion, what we really calculate is $\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(X_i = 6)(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n [X_i(\\omega) = 6]$. As I've said, in practice nobody writes $\\omega$ in such formulas, but I'd like you to pay attention where I've written it on both sides. On the right hand side, it's next to $X_i$ - because this $X_i$ becomes a number when we throw the dice. On the left hand side, it's not next to $X_i$ - that's because $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=6)$ is a quantity from probability theory, and writing $\\mathbb{P}(X_i(\\omega)=6)$ doesn't make sense.     \n","\n","Throwing a dice is a very simple example of a random experiment. In the next exercise, we'll deal with a more complicated random variable: the length of a randomly selected human protein (here, the length is measured in terms of the number of amino acids). The parameter that we want to estimate is the average length of a human protein.  \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SjVsjUljgcXy"},"source":["**Exercise 2.** In this exercise, we'll do an empirical analysis of the properties of the estimator of the mean. We'll use a sample of $N=1000$ randomly selected human proteins. Denote $X_i$ as the length of a randomly selected human protein, and $\\log(X_i)$ as its base-10 logarithm.

This is what we call the true mean and standard deviation.\n","- The randomly selected length is a random variable, let's call it $X$.\n","- The expected value of $X$, denoted $\\mathbb{E}(X)$, is a constant value calculated theoretically and equal to the true mean $\\mu$.\n","- The mean protein length estimated from the sample of size $N$ is a random variable $\\hat{\\mu}_X$ - an estimator of the true expected value $\\mu$ of a random variable $X$.\n","- The estimator has its own expected value and standard deviation - which are not random quantities, but parameters calculated analytically, i.e., they are constant values again. We have $\\mathbb{E}\\hat{\\mu} = \\mu$, i.e. the empirical mean is an unbiased estimator of the true mean. This is (almost) never true for the estimator of the standard deviation (unless you use some custom estimators for specific distributions or have very simple data).\n","- The mean of the means calculated on 1000 samples is again a random variable - it's another estimator, that we could (but probably shouldn't...) denote as $\\hat{\\mu}_\\hat{\\mu}$, an estimator of the true expected value of a random variable $\\hat{\\mu}$.\n","- In summary: if we calculate, e.g., a standard deviation of 1000 empirical means, we get an estimate (a random value) of the standard deviation (a constant value) of the estimator (a random value) of the true mean (a constant value) of the length of a randomly selected protein (a random value).  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"o7iLP58z5xvr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Exercise 3.** The standard deviation of an unbiased estimator tells us how much it fluctuates around the true value. An estimator with a lower standard deviation will more often give us values that are close to the true one. This way, we can compare two estimators of the same thing.  \n","\n","However, the standard deviation is often not that useful when comparing the measurements of two different things. This is because it depends on the units of the measurement. Suppose we measure the length $L$ of some objects in meters, and the standard deviation of the measurement is $\\text{sd}(L)$. Measuring the same object in centimeters will give us a measurement equal $100L$, and the corresponding standard deviation $\\text{sd}(100L) = 100\\text{sd}(L)$ will appear to be much larger, but it doesn't mean that measurements in centimeters are more difficult. To make matters worse, in real-life applications, the variability of the measurement often depends on its average value, regardless of the units. The standard deviation of the height of a mouse (a few milimeters) is much lower than the one of an elephant (several centimeters), but it doesn't mean that mice are easier to measure. Similarly, in the case of protein length and log-length, the latter is much smaller, so it can be expected that its standard deviation will be smaller as well.\n","\n","To evaluate the variability of an estimator regardless of its units and the average value, we can calculate a so-called [*coefficient of variation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation) (variation, not variance!).

estimator for a fixed sample size $N$, and we can use this knowledge to do something even more useful: determining how many observations we need for an estimation with a given precision.\n","\n","1. Using the equations for the expected value and the standard deviation of the estimator of the mean, $\\hat{\\mu}_X = \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i/N$ where $X_i$ is the length of a randomly selected protein, calculate the sample size $N^*$ that we need to take in order for the standard deviation of the estimator to be equal to a fraction $p$ of the true mean (i.e. $\\sigma_\\hat{\\mu} = p\\mu$; note the lack of a hat above sigma - it's not a random variable, but a parameter of the estimator). Express it in terms of coefficients of variability. You will need to assume that the standard deviation of the protein length is known; use the value in the `true_std` variable from Exercise 1.\n","2. Calculate $N^*$ for the estimator of the average log-length (use the true standard deviation of protein log-lengths in the `true_std_log` variable). Is there a noticeable difference compared to the estimator of the average length? Which quantity is easier to estimate?   \n","2. Analyze one of the estimators for a sample of size of the corresponding $N^*$: visualize its distribution, estimate its bias, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and RMSE. You can simply modify the code from the previous exercises.   \n","  2.1 Use the results to verify if your calculation of $N^*$ was correct.  \n","  2.2 How did the distribution of the estimator change compared to the previous sample size ($N = 1000$)?  \n","3. *Quick question 1*. Does $N^*$ depend on the number of proteins that humans have? In order to get the same precision of the estimation (measured in terms of the RMSE), would you need a larger sample size if humans had a million proteins?  \n","4. *Quick question 2.* Does $N^*$ depend on the distribution of the data?\n","\n","\n","*Note.* In practice, the estimation of $N^*$ is often more difficult, because we usually don't know the true standard deviation; instead, we need to estimate it and take into account the error of this estimation when deriving $N^*$. Because of this, the required sample size will typically be larger than in the case of a known standard deviation. This topic is too complex to cover in this course, so we'll focus on the simpler case with a known standard deviation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["p = 0.01\n","N = math.ceil((true_std / (p *

We'll focus on confidence intervals for the true mean (i.e., the expected value) of a normally distributed population -- this is one of the most commonly used and one of the most useful confidence intervals.\n","\n","For the expected value of a normally distributed random variable, there are two commonly used confidence intervals: the confidence interval when the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known, given by the equation\n","\n","$$\\left (\\hat{\\mu} - q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}},\\quad \\hat{\\mu} + q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\right ), $$\n","where $q_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution at the level of $1-\\alpha/2$; and the confidence interval when the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown, given by the equation\n","\n","$$\\left (\\hat{\\mu} - t_{1-\\alpha/2, N-1}\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{N}},\\quad \\hat{\\mu} + t_{1-\\alpha/2, N-1}\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\right ), $$\n","where $t_{1-\\alpha/2, N-1}$ is the quantile of the Student's $t$ distribution with $N-1$ degrees of freedom at the level of $1-\\alpha/2$, and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is the square root of the **unbiased** estimator of the variance, i.e. $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2/(N-1)}$, where $\\bar{X} = \\hat{\\mu} = \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i/N$.\n","\n","If we simply plug $\\hat{\\sigma}$ instead of $\\sigma$ in the first kind of the confidence interval (the one for a known $\\sigma$), we get a third type of a confidence interval, a so-called *asymptotic confidence interval* for the mean; the name *asymptotic* comes from the fact that $\\hat{\\sigma} → \\sigma$ as $N → ∞$.
