The estimators of $\\beta$, which we denote as $\\hat{\\beta}$, are random variables. This is because they're calculated using the the dependent variable $Y$, which, due to the presence of random errors, is a random variable $Y\\sim \\mathcal{N}(X\\beta, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the error term $\\epsilon$ (remember the definition of a linear model). As all random variables, the variables $\\hat{\\beta}$ have their expected value and variance. For an Ordinary Least Squares regression, we have $\\mathbb{E}\\hat{\\beta} = \\beta$, so this particular kind of estimation is unbiased - but there are other ways, which we will see in a moment. First, however, note that this consideration means that we also have a variance - bias tradeoff when we compute predicted values for new data - the predictions are random variables, because they are based on the observed values of $Y$, so they have their expected value and variance.\n","\n","This tradeoff is closely connected to the problem of *overfitting*. This happens when our model fits the training data too well and it learns to predict not only the trends, but also the random errors.\n","When the model is overfitted, it mimics the errors from the training data set when we use it for forecasting - and because of this, it is biased (in the sense that after the training is completed, the model may systemically under- or overestimate the predicted values for new data). This usually happens when our training data set is too small, e.g. when the number of observations is similar to the number of predictors, or when the training data set is selected incorrectly, e.g. when we forgot to randomly permute the observations, or when the training data is selected from some specific sub-population of observations.\n","\n","One of the approaches to deal with overfitting and the bias - variance tradeoff is to use *regularized* linear models. These are the alternative methods of estimating $\\beta$ which I mentioned above. Most commonly used ones are the $L_2$-regularized model, called the Ridge regression, and the $L_1$-regularized model, called the LASSO:\n","\n","$$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{Ridge}} = \\text{argmin}_\\beta ||Y - X\\beta||^2 + \\alpha ||\\beta||^2$$\n","\n","$$\\hat \\beta_{\\text{LASSO}} = \\text{argmin}_\\beta ||Y - X\\beta||^2 + \\alpha |\\beta|$$\n","\n","Although they seem similar, they have different properties and applications.  \n","\n","An important caveat is that we typically do not include the intercept, $\\beta_0$, in the penalty term - we only regularize the $\\beta$ coefficients that correspond to measurements in $X$. This is because the intercept typically doesn't overfit - it is equal to the average value of $Y$ when all the predictors in $X$ are equal to zero, and averages are not that prone to overfitting. Introducing a penalty for the intercept therefore would introduce a bias in the estimation a term that is otherwise easy to estimate, so it does more harm than good.  \n","\n","In practice, we can avoid all these problems and difficult considerations about the intercept by simply centering all the variables - i.e. subtracting their means from them. This includes both the independent variables $X$ and the dependent variable $Y$. After centering the whole data set, the average value of $Y$ when $X=0$ is equal to zero - so the intercept simply disappears.

For a baseline model (i.e. a simple model to which we will compare the improved ones), create an ordinary least squares linear model (with an intercept) explaining the disease progression using all the other variables. Use the `statsmodels` library (the documentation is available [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html); check the \"Examples\" section of the documentation to see how to fit a simple model). Check the summary of the model.   \n","  1.1. Are the coefficients jointly significant (in other words, is the *whole model* significant)?

Answer by comparing the coefficients and checking which ones are positive or negative and their magnitudes.   \n","4. Now, fit a Lasso model to the data, by using either the `Lasso` or the `LassoLars` function from `scikit-learn` (they implement two different algorithms to calculate the coefficients). Use any value of the `alpha` parameter that you like (for example 0.1, 1, or 10) - we will see how to choose it better in Exercise 3.  \n","  Note that, as opposed to Ridge and OLS, the coefficients of the Lasso model are calculated numerically using iterative procedures.

regularization parameters. In this exercise, we will finally see how to properly select the values of these parameters. The answer is, again, cross-validation. We create a range of parameter values to inspect, e.g. with `np.linspace(0, 1, num=100)`, and, for each value, we perform a cross-validation to estimate the prediction error. Finally, we select the parameter which gives the lowest error.  \n","\n","1. Use the `GridSearchCV` function from `scikit` to find the optimal regularization parameter for the Ridge regression on the diabetes dataset that you pre-processed in Exercise 1.

most common techniques of exploratory data analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a transformation of the features (the columns of the data set) into *principal components*, which are weighted sums of the columns:\n","$$PC_i = w_{i1} X_1 + \\dots + w_{ik}X_k,$$\n","where $X_1, \\dots, X_k$ are the columns of our data frame and $w_{ij}$ is the weight associated with $i$-th principal component and $j$-th column.\n","\n","The first principal component corresponds to the direction of the largest variance of the data set - that is, the direction in which our data set is \"biggest\".  Each next principal component is selected to maximize the variance in a subspace perpendicular to all the previous components. PCA allows us to detect trends in high-dimentional data, reduce the number of dimentions, and visualize the data set on a two-dimentional scatter plot. This can be used, for example, for a rough check if the data contains clusters.  \n","\n","The transformation is defined so that for each principal component, the vector of weights has a unit length: $w_{i1}^2 + \\dots + w_{ik}^2 = 1$. The components of these vectors, $w_{ij}$ are also called *loadings*, and $w_{i}$ are called *loading vectors*.  \n","\n","Did I just write that $w_{ij}$ are called loadings? I'm sorry, I meant to write that *a lot authors* call them loadings. For example, that's the name used in *The Elements of Statistical Learning*, one of the most influential sources in statistics. But other authors use the term *loadings* to refer to the vectors of weights multiplied by the standard deviation of the data projected onto the associated component (i.e. $w_i \\cdot \\text{sd}(PC_i)$). For example, that's the name used on Wikipedia, also one of the most influential sources in statistics. In this course, we follow the convention from *The Elements of Statistical Learning*.\n","\n","To add to the confusion, there are even more naming conventions: some authors call the $w_{i}$ the principal components, and call $PC_i$ the *scores* or the *principal component scores*. Some other authors call $w_{i}$ the *principal axes* or *principal directions*. Unfortunately, the terminology used in PCA is *unbelievably* inconsistent (see the discussions [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/88118/what-exactly-is-called-principal-component-in-pca), [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues), [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/125684/how-does-fundamental-theorem-of-factor-analysis-apply-to-pca-or-how-are-pca-l), [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/143905/loadings-vs-eigenvectors-in-pca-when-to-use-one-or-another), [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134282/relationship-between-svd-and-pca-how-to-use-svd-to-perform-pca)...).  \n","\n","Because of this inconsistency, you cannot rely too much on terminology when you read about PCA from different sources. You need to understand the mathematics and figure out from context what people mean by all these terms. To make it simpler, remember that we have four main mathematical concepts:\n"," - the $w_{i}$, which are vectors that point to the directions of the maximum variances in the data (i.e. the directions in which the data is \"the biggest\"). In this course, we call this the *principal directions* or *loadings*;\n"," - the $PC_i$, which are columns of the data points projected onto the $w_i$ vectors (i.e. the transformed observations). In this course, we call this the *principal components*;\n"," - the $\\text{sd}(PC_i)$, which is the variance of the data after projecting it onto $w_i$ (i.e. the variance \"explained\" by the direction $w_i$). In this course, we call this the *variances*;\n"," - the $w_i \\cdot \\text{sd}(PC_i)$, which is a hybrid concept that combines the i-th direction of the biggest variance with the amount of variance explained by that direction. In this course, we don't use a special name.   \n","\n","PCA always assumes that the data is **centered** - meaning that values in each column sum up to zero.

We will do this without looking at the target variable - this is an *unsupervised* technique. We're not interested in the progression of diabetes in this case, but rather in detecting potential problems with our data set such as the presence of distinct groups of patients or redundant variables.  \n","\n","1.

Try to figure out whether the first principal component represents some meaningful quantity, i.e. whether you can explain its meaning in medical terms. The descriptions of the s1-s6 variables can be found in the [documentation of the data set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset).  \n","5. Now, perform a centering and scaling of the data, i.e. subtract the mean from each column and then divide each column by the standard deviation of its values, and fit the PCA again or, in case you already worked on scaled data, try to do a PCA without scaling. Repeat points 2-4. Which results changed? Why? In particular, did the interpretation of the principal components change? Why?\n","6. Create a scatter plot of PC1 vs PC2, and a scatter plot of PC3 vs PC4. You can obtain the values of the principal components by either running the `PCA.fit_transform()` function or first running the `PCA.fit()` and then the `PCA.transform()` functions.   \n","  7.1. Does the sampled population appear homogeneous, or are there distinct sub-groups?  \n","  7.2. Do you see any outlying observations?  \n","7. Color the points of the scatter plots by the corresponding value of the target variable. Do you see any patterns? Compare scatter plots for PCA with and without scaling of the variables.  \n","\n","     \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RYFCrmbQSic9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Put your code

Suppose our data comes from a linear model $Y_i = \\beta_0 + x_i^T\\beta + \\epsilon_i$, where $x_i, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$, and $\\mathbb{E}\\epsilon_i = 0$ for all i.

Because of this, if we centered the $X$ matrix, then we can estimate the intercept simply as $\\bar{Y}$ and then remove it from $Y$ and fit a model without intercept.  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"SdmADnC2pSrp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<center><img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12CrUdXDAiltLBT26sG7HZ_HciIhvGyT8'></center>|"],"metadata":{"id":"UOuwnYv3ZM9U"}}]}
