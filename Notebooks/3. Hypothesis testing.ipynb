Because in general, confirming them is impossible using random samples. For example, let's suppose that we study the toxicity of a new drug by giving it to 10 rats and observing them for a week. Just because the rats didn't get sick may suggest that the drug is safe, but it doesn't prove it - after all, it's just 10 animals observed for a short time. On the other hand, if all the 10 animals get sick (and the control group is fine), we can definitely reject the hypothesis that the drug is safe.   \n","\n","Another example: let's suppose we have a hypothesis that the average log-length of a human protein is equal 2.30, and we sample 200 proteins to verify it. If their average log-length turns out to be similar to 2.30 - for example, 2.31 with a standard deviation 0.1 - this doesn't prove our hypothesis. The true average log-length may still be equal, for example, 2.29 or 2.305. However, if the average log-length of our sample turns out to be 2.70 with a standard deviation 0.1, this is a strong evidence that our hypothesis is false.  \n","\n","More generally: just because some data somewhat agree with our beliefs doesn't prove that our beliefs are true. However, if the data contradicts our beliefs, then it proves our beliefs are false.  \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GwGqN5_Q4162"},"source":["## Data & library

When this assumption is only slightly violated, like for the protein log-length data, the results may still be reliable, especially for large sample sizes. For many data sets, as the sample size increases, the distribution of the estimator of the mean converges to the Normal one (this is guaranteed by the Central Limit Theorem). This means that the estimator of the mean is distributed \"more normally\" than the original data (where \"more normal\" refers to the distance between the cumulative distribution functions). This increases the robustness of the t-test for small deviations from normality. However, when this assumption is strongly violated, like for the non-transformed protein length data, the results are no longer reliable. One way to solve this problem is to use non-parametric tests. A non-parametric test is defined as a test that does not rely on the assumption of a distribution of the data.   \n","\n","One of the most common non-parametric tests is the Mann-Whitney U-test, also known as the two-sample Wilcoxon's test. It's often used as a replacement for the Student's t-test when the data is not distributed normally. However, the null hypotheses of these two tests are different, and it's important to understand this difference to avoid misleading results.\n","\n","In contrast to the Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney's one doesn't test the equality of parameters like the mean - hence the name *non-parametric*. Instead, its null hypothesis is that $\\mathbb{P}(X > Y) = 1/2$, i.e., that if we take a random observation $X$ from the first sample, and a random observation $Y$ from the second sample, it's equally likely that the first is greater or smaller than the second. A one-sided alternative hypothesis may be, e.g., that  $\\mathbb{P}(X > Y) > 1/2$, i.e., that samples from the first population tend to be larger than sample from the second one. In this case, we say that the first sample is *stochastically greater* than the second one.  \n","\n","Sidenote: the actual null hypothesis of the Mann-Whitney test is slightly different, but the one described above is a very close approximation that's much simpler to interpret and use in practice.   \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WAE4UD_IS5Lx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Exercise 3.\\*** Implement you own version of the Mann-Whitney's test.

One of the most useful ones is the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, which controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), i.e. the proportion of false positives among all positive results.

"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the next exercise, we will use *stochastic simulations* to generate our own data. First, however, let's talk about what it means to simulate a random variable.  \n","\n","*Theory time.* The term *simulating a random variable* is confusing for many students, especially the ones that paid attention in probability classes. Recall that a random variable $X$ is a function from the space of elementary outcomes $\\Omega$ to the space of real (or integer) numbers. When some students hear \"let's simulate a sequence of random variables $X_1, \\dots, X_n$, they wonder: how do we simulate a sequence of functions? Well, this is not what we mean at all.   \n","\n","We define random variables as functions because we want to have a mathematical model of randomness. This is a convenient way to rigorously define what it means that a variable $X$ takes some value with some probability. For example, we can use it to formally define $\\mathbb{P}(X=1) = \\mathbb{P}(\\{ \\omega: X(\\omega)  =1 \\})$. We need this definition, because the concept of probability is defined on the space $\\Omega$, not on the real numbers. However, this is not how we interpret or use random variables in practice.\n","\n","Recall that the number of dots on a set of dice is a sequence of random variables $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ before you throw the dice. When you throw them, you get realizations of the random variables, $X_1(\\omega), \\dots, X_n(\\omega)$, which are a sequence of numbers (and often called *random numbers*). Measuring the outcome of a random experiment corresponds to fixing $\\omega$ in a sequence of random variables. This is why we can interpret random variables as numerical variables. Defining them as functions is necessary only because otherwise terms like $\\mathbb{P}(X=1)$ don't have any mathematical meaning.\n","\n","\"Fixing $\\omega$\" is also what we mean by simulating a sequence of random variables: we want to get a sequence of numbers $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ that are realizations of a sequence of random variables $X_1, \\dots X_n$, so that $x_i = X_i(\\omega)$. However, simulating doesn't mean that we pick $\\omega$ by hand. Remember that $\\omega$ is mostly a mathematical model, not a physical being. Instead of selecting it by hand, we rely on random number generators that \"fix $\\omega$\" for us.   \n","\n","You have already encountered a few random number generators. A set of dice is one of them. When you throw the dice, you can imagine that the action of throwing corresponds to fixing $\\omega$ in a sequence of random variables - and you get a sequence of numbers as a result. You probably have also used pseudo-random number generators in your programs. These are algorithms that return pseudo-random numbers between 0 and 1. When you run this algorithm, you can imagine that this corresponds to fixing $\\omega$ in a random variable $X\\sim U([0, 1])$ - and you get a random number as a result.   \n","\n","These two random number generators (the dice and the algorithm) return numbers with very simple distributions. However, we can simulate random numbers with many other distributions, such as the Normal one. There are many techniques to do this, which usually rely on transforming random numbers distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 (formally speaking, numbers which are a realization of a sequence of random variables $X_i$ such that $X_i \\sim_{iid} U([0, 1])$) (iid means independent and identically distributed, próba prosta in polish). In this course, you don't need to worry about these techniques: we will simulate random variables using algorithms which are already implemented in Python libraries.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hKBr6c7ttByS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vSM59hWBC2NP"},"source":["**Exercise 9.** In this exercise, we'll learn how to use the Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control the False Discovery Rate, as well as how to simulate our own data sets.

it is correct but can be improved. For each point, say whether all the assumptions are satisfied, and whether the methodology can be improved (e.g. by using a different statistical test or correction procedure). If the assumptions are violated, discuss the possible effect of this kind of violation. For extra points, support your claims with theoretical arguments or simulations.        \n","1. A researcher studies the effect of glucose consumption on rat well-being. The researcher has partitioned $N=20$ rats into two groups: an experimental one with excess glucose in the diet, and a control one with a normal diet. After a week, the researcher has measured the weight of the rats, the length of sleep, the blood glucose level, the abdominal circumference, the body fat percentage, and the anxiety level (using the elevated plus maze assay). The researcher has compared each factor between the experimental and the control group using the two-sample Student's t test for unpaired observations, previously verifying that the compared variables are normally distributed using the Shapiro-Wilk's test. Next, the researcher has corrected the Student's t test p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction at FDR level 20%.   \n","2. A researcher studies the effect of consumption of small amounts of vinegar on the increase of the blood glucose level (BGC) in mice. The researcher has partitioned $N=20$ mice into equally-sized experimental and control groups. At the beginning of the experiment, he has measured the BGC of all mice. Next, for four days, mice from both groups were given a diet enriched in glucose. Mice from the experimental groups were also given small amounts of vinegar in their diet. After four days, the BGC of all mice was measured again. Next, in each group, the researcher has tested for the increase in BGC using a two-sample Student's t-test for unpaired observations.  \n","3. A researcher studies the effect of artificial sweeteners on the blood glucose level (BGC) in mice. The researcher has partitioned $N=100$ mice into ten equally-sized groups: nine experimental and one control. Mice in the control group were given a normal diet. In the respective experimental groups, the mice were given food enriched in glucose; sucralose; aspartam; erythritol; stevia; xylitol; saccharine; acesulfam K; manninol. After four days, the researcher has measured the BGC of all mice. Next, the researcher has used the two-sample Student's t test for unpaired observations to compare the average BGC between the ten groups. To correct for multiple tests, the researcher has used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure at FDR level 20%.      \n","4. A researcher studies the effect of salt consumption on the abdominal circumference (AC) in mice. The researcher has partitioned $N=20$ mice into equally-sized experimental and control groups. The AC of all mice was measured at the beginning of the experiment. Mice from the experimental group were given a diet enriched in salt. After a week, the AC was measured again, and the researcher used a two-sample Student's t test for paired observations in each group. The results of the test in each group were insigificant, and the researcher concluded that salt consumption does not increase the abdominal circumference in the span of one week.
